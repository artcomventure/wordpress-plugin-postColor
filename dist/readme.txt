== Description ==

== Installation ==

1. Upload files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.

* ... or clone repository:
  ```
  $ cd /PATH/TO/WORDPRESS/wp-content/plugins/

If you want a different folder name than `wordpress-plugin-postColor` extend clone command by ` 'FOLDERNAME'` (replace the word `'FOLDERNAME'` by your chosen one):
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-postColor.git 'FOLDERNAME'
  ```
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

== Plugin Updates ==

Although the plugin is not _yet_ listed on https://wordpress.org/plugins/, you can use WordPress' update functionality to keep it in sync with the files from [GitHub](https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-postColor).

**Please use for this our [WordPress Repository Updater](https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-repoUpdater)** with the settings:

* Repository URL: https://github.com/artcomventure/wordpress-plugin-postColor/
* Subfolder (optionally, if you don't want/need the development files in your environment): dist

_We test our plugin through its paces, but we advise you to take all safety precautions before the update. Just in case of the unexpected._
